  content: `It is my personal pleasure to say something on the book "The teaching of English" written by the devoted and dedicated teacher, Dr. Mohini Sharma.

The importance of English in our society cannot be underestimated. After 1947, when India achieved its long awaited freedom from British Raj, English as a language also lost its prime position and become the second language, still the charm of learning English continues and in the recent years there is a mushroom growth of English medium public schools and English as a language has more allurement for the parents for the causes and purposes unknown.

Now, the need is of good English Teachers especially in Gujarat State, where uptill now we treated English as the step daughter. Now, we need English teachers who have the comprehensive knowledge of the science of the English language. Know the methods, tools and techniques essential for teaching English and can safely present the material in the classroom accordance to the latest technological era and bring desired and expected behavioural changes in the learners from the point of view of listening, speaking and writing skills.

The need also arouses of some such books on the teaching of English which can safety cater to the needs of the English teacher in the making and equip him with all the essential skills needed in the teaching of English. Dr. Mohini Sharma has laboured to prepare such a book in a very short time which caters to the needs, from the syllabi point and beyond it. The book deals with the three perspectives of languages. Viz., Conceptual content, linguistic content and methodology. Dr. Mohini Sharma actively working not only in the field of Education but also as the counsellor, has won twice the awards for her counselling excellence from New Delhi. Her book "Vibrations" and "Spoken English" will be soon in the market.

I am hopeful that this endeavor of Dr. Sharma will prove a useful handbook for the teachers of English and the English teachers in the making.

I wish Dr. Sharma, the writer her apt presentation and her book 'The Teaching of English' a success.`,

  content: `Goethe Says, 'One who does not know any foreign language, knows nothing of his own.' English language has been accepted as international language by most of the people of the world. The present question that deserves all our attention is not whether or not we want English in our country but in what ways shall we upgrade the fast declining standard of teaching-learning process of English in India and especially in Gujarat. There are institutes of English, spoken English and other areas, of the English language, mushrooming everywhere. But the basics of the language are taught and learnt at school invariably.

The teaching-learning process of English in India is mostly based on textbookishness by which the language is seriously handicapped. The English Teacher should approach English teaching from three major perspectives which are: (i) the conceptual content (ii) Linguistic contentant (iii) the methodology.

We have by now quite a large number of good books on English teaching, which does not apparently justify the addition of one more by me. However, there are some definite reasons which made me write this book. This book is meant to meet the need of English both in schools and in Training colleges. The book is also a handbook of practical suggestions on teaching of English, however, I am also coming up with more practical suggestion in another book on language teaching also. The purpose of the book is to provide an orientation to English teachers who are too much in the rut of the routine method of teaching and is not able to get out of it.

Whosoever born on the planet orb (Earth) is not complete. Though I tried my level best to present the book with all the aspects, there may exist the limitations also, suggestion of the readers are always welcome for the same. I also put forward that I tried my best to write the book in simple language so that it could be used even by primary teachers. I have no regret to sacrifice the idiomatic language in writing this book because I always kept this notion in my mind that English is a foreign language.

I express my sincere gratitude to all the persons who helped me in completing this book. I also owe my sincere thanks and a debt to "Akshar Publication, Ahmedabad" for the Publishing of this book. My deep appreciation goes to the management Shri Khambhat Taluka Sarvavanjka Kelavani Mandal, my teachers, my colleagues and students since they have been the source of my feedback in writing the book.

I look forward for the worth of this book for readers, teachers and students. I shall be highly obliged if they send me some valuable suggestions for the betterment of this book.

    title: "Chapter 1: The State of English Teaching in India",
    content: `## (I) THE STATE OF ENGLISH TEACHING IN INDIA

"The more advanced a language is, the more developed is its power of expressing abstract or general ideas".

English is such a language which is universally renowned for its power of expression of thoughts and feeling as a social group. But English is a foreign language for Indians.

English was introduced in India two centuries ago by the East India Company, first for trade and commerce. Later, the language made inroads into all spheres of public life, became the medium of instruction in schools and colleges and exercised for reaching influence on the country, beyond the wildest dreams of the founders. Macaulay in his Minute of 1835 visualized the total westernization of Indian life and culture. Many of our countrymen mastered the English language, which fascinated the Westerners.

Lord William Bentinck extended patronage to English and European literature and science. English became the language of administration and justice. But Lord Curzon bemoaned the influence of English an vernacular Education Wood's Dispatch of 1854 set right the balance by saying that Vernaculars had their place in mass education and English had only a limited role.

### In short, the place of English before Independence:

- It was the official language of administration and courts.
- English helped in perfecting the art of governance, democratic debate and discussion.
- It was medium of instruction in schools and colleges.
- It was the medium of teaching.
- It was the language to develop the understanding between the rulers and the subject.

### English after Independence:

In our country, people have been learning English since it was first introduced in schools in the second half of the nineteenth in the first fifty years the purpose of learning English was to get a Government job. But later English was learnt for:

- Studying in foreign countries.
- To enrich the work profile to work in foreign countries
- Studying professional courses like Para medical courses, medicine, Engineering etc. in our country which are almost designed in English only.
- Studying English literature and so on.

After independence, the inclusion of English in school curriculum was debated at all kinds of for a Arguments for English out weighed the others with special support from scholars- administrators like Jawaharlal Nehru, academician like Pro. Gokak and others.

Mahatma Gandhi advocated the development of Indian languages and advised us not to be blind imitators of the west in a few people should learn English to represent India in abroad. C. Rajagopalachari said that English was the gift of Goddess Saraswati to India and that in our anger and hatred, we should not throwaway the baby (English) with the bath water (the English people). Pandit Nehru said "I completely accept the statement that people cannot really grow except through their language but it does not follow that in order to make their language grow, a barrier should be erected between them and others." (1957) Again he said "It is patient to me that this man power for industrial, scientific and agriculture purposes cannot be trained in any Indian language in the foreseeable future. It is absolutely clear to me and it is not an arguable matter that training has to be given in English." He called English 'a window on the modern world'.

With the adoption of the Indian Constitution in 1950 English was allowed to continue as our official language for fifteen years during which period Hindi, the national language would be developed to take its place. But there was opposition to the introduction of the Hindi, from the southern states. Consequently, in 1963 parliament by an Act decided to accord English the status of associate official language of India for an indefinite period. And that is the position even today. English serves as link language between states and center, as a language of administration and justice in many states. It is a compulsory language in some states, taught from I/II/V/VIII and optional in some states. It is the medium of instruction in professional colleges and universities. Regional languages have vastly developed after the formation of Linguistic states and they are now the media of instruction in schools and colleges even upto P.G. level in many states.

There were few education commissions and committee appointed by the Government of India. The views of there expert bodies throw light on the changing fortunes of English in the curriculum of schools and colleges.

- **The University Education Commission (1948)** stressed the need to learn English to keep in touch with the stream of knowledge and to prevent our isolation.
- **The Mudaliar Commission (1953)** emphasized the adoption of dynamic methods of teaching English and other subjects.
- **The Central Advisory Board of Education (CABE)** suggested the three language formula, whereby the regional language, mother tongue, Hindi/Indian language/ and English should be taught in all schools, the stages of introduction of Hindi and English were left to the state Governments.
- **The Kothari Commission 1964-66** favoured the learning of English as a library language, stressing reading and reference skills.
- **The Study Group (Prof: Gokak)** recommended the structural approach to the teaching of English and emphasized the importance of Men (teachers), Materials (books), and methodology.
- **The National Policy of Education (NPE) 1968** said that regional languages which were making rapid strides should be the media of instruction at college level also. The NPE (1968) and the Programme of Action (POA) were all for strengthening languages. The Navodaya Vidyalayas came into being in pursuance of POA (1986).
- **The Acharya Rama Murthy committee 1986** has endorsed the three language formula and suggested the specifications of minimum levels of learning (MLL) at cut off stages.

None of these recommendations said anything English, which is a point in its favour. The growth of English medium schools favoured explicitly by parents and implicitly by Government, has its own story to tell about the popularity of the English language.

There are three aspects of its importance to India: (1) It continues to be a link language within the country and outside, (2) It is a library language, which brings the world of knowledge to one's library, if not to the door step, (3) English opens the window on the world of science & technology, trade & commerce, and telecommunication, space technology etc. We can ignore these vital features of English at our own peril in modern times.`,

    content: `## (2) THE IMPORTANCE OF LEARNING ENGLISH IN INDIA

English language is an easy means of communication in the international sphere of life. It is the language which can be easily understood in different parts of the world. Dennis Bloodworth is of the opinion that near about 300 million people of the world speaks English with the growth of trade and commerce; it has spread far outside England. At present it has become a language of universal cultural which embraces so many departments of knowledge.

> "Anyone who can read English can keep in touch with world without living his own house" - F. G. French

> "No language ancient and modern can be compared with English in the number of its speakers, writers and readers all over the world" - F. G. French

> "English is a language which is rich in literature, humanistic, scientific and technical. If under sentimental urges we should give up English, we would cut ourselves off from the living stream of ever-growing knowledge" - Radhakrishna University

One in ten persons of the world knows English. English is the first language of England, Australia, Canada and U.S.A. It is the second language of many countries like Russia, France, Germany, India and Pakistan etc. It is the official language of U.N.O. All books of science and technology are written in English language. That is why in English language is the window on modern world. If we close this knowledge of the world and return back into the darkness of ignorance of Middle Ages. We will fall back hundreds of years and will never be able to catch up the race of the developed world.

In the words of Mahatma Gandhi, "English is a language of international commerce; is the language of diplomacy and it contains many a rich literary treasure; it gives us an introduction to western thoughts and culture."

However this study should be at the cost of national language or regional languages. In this regard, the following words of Maulana Abdul Kalam Azad, latterly the Minister of Education Government of India, are worth quoting:

> "So far as General studies are concerned, it was never my intention to suggest that there should be any falling in the standard of English. Hundred and fifty years of intimate contact has made English an integral part of our educational system and this cannot be changed without injury to the cause of education in India.

> In addition, English has today become one of the major languages of the world and Indians can neglect its study only at the risk of loss to themselves. I am convinced that in future as well the standard of teaching should be maintained at high a level as possible."`,

    title: "Chapter 3: Factors Responsible for Universal Importance of English",
    content: `## (3) FACTORS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE UNIVERSAL IMPORTANCE OF ENGLISH LANGUAGE IN INDIA AND ESPECIALLY IN GUJARAT

India is multilingual country. The constitution of India recognized more than fifteen languages. About 845 languages are spoken in India. Language is the basis in the formation of each state. English is link language. It is known to the educated people all over the country. Therefore, it is important for having inter-state links and communication on the following matters:

- Trade
- Administration & Management
- Social Affairs
- Cultural & Educational Exchanges

Gujarat is the industrialist state and Gujarat are known for business and trade, so the command over English may enhance the growth of business.

English is a language that gives birth of feeling of internationalism and also develops it. It does contribute to the Indian Philosophy of world fraternity. In the present set-up national integration is very much needed, it plays a vital role in this field also.

With the help of this language, we can communicate with foreigners and people of their countries. We can understand their ideas, feelings and point of views. It can serve as a means of communication in the international through world. And Gujarat is known as NRI'S and many of the students also go abroad for studies, so English plays a vital role in that.

English is the key to the treasure house of knowledge, Most of the books of higher knowledge in different field i.e. science, technology, humanities and literature are found in English language. The graduate and post graduate and research students need to consult libraries. Good reference-books are found in English language. It is language of science, law, medicine, engineering and agriculture. That is why English occupies the position of library language. The Kathari Commission has emphasized that English would play a vital role in higher education as an important library language.

English language is the store house of culture. It promotes universal brotherhood, friendship, tolerance, sympathy and benevolence. English culture and literature have influenced the culture and literature of India. English language gives us the insight into the different cultures of various societies and countries. English culture is collection of different cultures of various advanced countries. And Gujarat is store house of culture. Gujarat culture can be better understood its richness value can only be known if we have studied other cultures, for that we need the knowledge of English.

English language has been the official language of India for more than 200 years. It has been also declared the associated official language of the union of indefinite period by the constitutional amendment in 1963. All the official work of administration and management is done in English language in most of the states of our country.

English still is the language of courts all over India. It is the legal language for the Supreme Court, High Courts and the District courts. The legal cases are presented and pleaded and judgments are given in English language today.

Greater number of people of various nations find it more convenient to talk in English. They write letters in English. Ceremonial and invitation-cards are mostly printed in English: The so called highly and sophisticated sections of our society find it more suitable to talk in English.

English plays an important role in field of education. English is taught as a compulsory subject in most of the states of our country. It is medium of instruction of public schools, technical, medical, and law Institutions. Several English language Teaching centers and Regional Institution of English language have been set to train the teachers of English in new methods, techniques and approaches of teaching English language Gujarat lack back in making as the medium of instruction so Gujarat has suffered as lot, as specially Gujarati students lacked back in competitive exams like IAS, IPS, IFS, etc.

English is spoken and written in most of the departments, industries, managements, and offices in most of the countries. Therefore, English language provides us an opportunity to get employment all over the world.

### English: A Language of skill subject.

We place school subjects under two heads:

- **Content Subjects** - Economics, biology, science and maths
- **Skill Subjects** - Language, music, painting

It has four skills i.e. listening speaking, reading and writing.

This language can help to play the role of an agency for the establishment of world peace for the good of the welfare of the entire world. It is essential to have world peace and co-existence. Because of capacity to bring about international under-standing, this language can help in establishment of world peace.

It helps us to widen our vision. We grow liberal, generous and broad minded after coming in contact with the thoughts of other countries through this language.

It is experience that leads to perfection. In this task of perfection, contact with neighboring countries and distant lands can do a lot. It is possible with help of English language only.

This language helps the development and generation of human outlook. Our internal as well as external aspects of the personality can develop with the help of English language. In other words, this language helps the development of balanced personality.

English language helps the development of stability in our lives and it has stability that helps us to acquire cultural values.

### Conclusion:

It is clear from the above discussion that the teaching and study of English is almost essential at secondary as well as higher stages of education in India. But should always be borne in mind that this teaching should be well organized and properly integrated. It is a duty of teacher to make the student competent to read and understand English language and literature. Only then it shall be possible for them to acquire various qualities enumerated above. Taking an over all view of all India curricula, it may be concluded that in the present day curricula of India, English is occupying an important place and is taught in some of the state as a compulsory second language.

English is a compulsory subject to qualify the preliminary examination of civil services of union and States.

The above points tells the position and place of English in our, school curriculum in general in India, all the same, time also indicates the lack of uniform policy about its place. A quick step must be taken to give an appropriate that is, an important place to this language in school curriculum.`,

> "It is high time to frame the definite policy of English language." - Discuss the statement in reference to the Gujarat State.

> "English is a language which is rich in literature, humanistic, scientific and technical. It under sentimental urges, we give up English, we would cut ourselves off from the living stream of ever growing knowledge." - Radha Krishna Commission

English is holding a respectable position in the school curriculum of almost every state of our country. In Gujarat, the position of English is stated below.

### Position of upper Primary level (A)

**Status of English in curriculum**

The following three Language are to be studied from class V to VII English is taught as the third language. It is compulsory subject from fifth class. Six periods per week are given for the teaching of English in school timetable. The following diagram shows the status of English as the third language.

- **I Language** - Gujarati (The Regional Language)
- **II Language** - Hindi (The National Language)
- **III Language** - English (The foreign Language)

### The following diagram clarifies the scenario of English language at recent time:

- **In std I to IV** - From academic year 2006 it is compulsory, but exams are not taken yet in some private schools.
- **In std V to VII** - It is compulsory and exams are also conducted.
- **In std VIII to X** - It is compulsory in 8th and 9th and from academic year 2006 it has become compulsory in std. X
- **In std XI to XII** - It is compulsory in science stream but it is an optional in HSC common stream.
- **College** - At all the levels it is compulsory.

### POSITION OF ENGLISH AT SECONDARY LEVEL IN GUJARAT

English is being taught as a compulsory subject at secondary level in std: VIII and Std IX, i.e. for two years and it was voluntary subject in Std X, But it is now a compulsory at S.S.C. examination.

At higher secondary level, English is not being taught as a compulsory subject except in science stream.

But again it is being taught as a compulsory subject at college level. But it is not worthy, that students who passed their s.s.c. examination without English are also allowed to offer English as a main Subject at college level.

Again it is worth noting that the Government has planned a syllabus for std V to XII as well as syllabus for std VII to XII. This means that the Government has accepted the policy of two streams of English language teaching for the students through the Gujarati medium and higher level English for the English medium students.

"But the standard of English in Our state i.e. Gujarat is poor, who is at fault the Govt. policy or the teaching staff is difficult to judge. Just for the sake of English our students are suffering at the national as well as the international level. Intelligent student avoid to sit in the competition examinations or if they sit they hardly get success in such examination.

Again, it is worth noting that the National Policy of Education of 1986 recommended to make English compulsory at std. X in all the states but it is not made compulsory from academic year 2006.

The history of teaching of English in our state shows very clearly that our syllabus has always remained changing because of the change in the official policy. It also shows that there have been overlapping syllabi and even teaching programmes. The syllabus also does not seem to grow at various levels. The teaching of English has become very difficult because of the heterogeneous students in the class.

The English language opens new vistas of scientific and technological knowledge and breaks down those social barriers which bring about narrow out look of life. So, a quick step must be taken to give an appropriate that is, an important place to this language in our school curriculum and to teach English intensively to achieve all the objectives.

### Problem faced by Gujarati speaking child while learning English

Children retarded in Language are often poor in their academic achievement. The academic achievement in different subjects depends on the mastery over the language. Language is closely related to general intellectual development. The effective teaching of language influences the teaching of other subjects. English language is mostly taught as a second language in the Indian schools and in Gujarat State too. There are many problems, which create hindrances in the smooth and effective teaching of English and because of that the Gujarati speaking child faces many problems in learning English as a foreign language.

We all experience that students of Gujarati fail to express their ideas either in spoken or written English correctly, along with wrong pronunciation and spelling the words incorrectly.

With the background of Gujarati, the pupils commit many mistakes regarding the grammar, like word order use of tenses, sequences of tenses, use of articles, sentence pattern, use of punctuation marks etc. unfortunately, most of the teachers of English in India are not well aware of the basic principles of the teaching of English and so, including our (Gujarati Speaking students suffer to achieve the proper knowledge of English.

### Some of the basic problems pupils faces are:

- There are 26 letters in English alphabets while there are 33 in Gujarati. This seems that 26 alphabets have to produce all the sounds of Gujarati.
- Gujarati is highly phonetic language while English is not.
- Both the languages have different word-order in a sentence.
- It is difficult to find the equivalent of all the English word in Gujarati.
- The sentence patterns of both the languages are different. The sentence pattern in Gujarati is usually the S-O-V (Subject, Object, Verb) and the English is usually the S-V-O (Subject, Verb, Object) order.
- Use of article is very important in English and there is nothing like an article in Gujarati
- In English verb changes according to the number of its subject - for e.g. singular subject plural verb plural subject singular verb while in Gujarati verb changes according to number and gender of its subject.
- The structure words or function words have no exact equivalents in Gujarati.
- There is quite a difference in the use of tenses -Sequence of tense as maintained in English is not maintained in Gujarati.
- Indirect narration of the English language is a problem for Gujarati pupils.
- English spellings are a source of confusion for the pupils, as some letters we drop in pronunciation. for e.g. hour - 'h' is silent, knight - 'k' is silent
- The subtle difference in pronunciation of certain sounds cannot be learned by a Gujarati pupil, (e.g. what vote" truth, tooth) Stress, intonation and rhythm are different in both the languages.
- The interrogative patterns are also different in both the languages.
- Fear of English in students is common factor for not understanding English phobia.`,

    title: "Chapter 5: Main Problems of Teaching English in India",
    content: `## (5) THE MAIN PROBLEMS OF TEACHING ENGLISH IN INDIA IN SPECIAL REFERENCE TO GUJARAT

> "English is a language which is in literature, humanistic, scientific and technical. If under sentimental urges, we give up English, we would cut ourselves off from the living stream of ever growing knowledge." - Radha Krishna Commission

But what place do English occupy in our curriculum, we all are aware, on the other hand, we are also aware about the importance of teaching English and its rapid growing demand in day to-day life. Yet, there are many problems, which create hindrances in the smooth and effective teaching of English as a second language.

### The following are the problems of English teaching not only in Gujarat but in India also:

**(1) No specific aim:**
The teaching of English is not based upon the aims and objectives of teaching English. Neither the teachers nor the students are acquainted with the aims and objectives of teaching English. Their aim is to get through the examination. Therefore it is very necessary that teaching of English must be based on aims and objectives.

**(2) Lack of proper emphasis on various aspects of teaching:**
In fact, teaching of English has various aspects. It requires good practice of teaching pronunciation, spelling, composition, calligraphy etc. Now a day, proper attention is not paid to all these aspects of the teaching of English. It is not possible for the students to practise even what they have learnt orally. Teachers are more worried about finishing the course than imparting proper knowledge to their pupils. Their methods of teaching are not effective. They are very much circumscribed by various rules and regulations and so it is not possible for them to have a free hand in it.

Teaching of English at various stages of education is not co-related and co-ordinate. In fact teaching at various stages is of different types - Due to this defect the knowledge of the students is not though and well graded.

**(3) Over - crowded classes:**
Our classes are over crowded. English teachers are unable to solve the individual problems of English language, there is inconvenience due to the shortage of building and lack of furniture.

**(4) No uniformity of the beginning stage of English teaching:**
There is controversy with regard to the grade from which teaching should be introduced. Different patterns are adopted by different states. Due to this reason the national standard of English language varies from state to state. Moreover, if we see into the state policy for e.g. Gujarat, in Govt. Schools, English is taught according to the govt. rules while in self finance schools, English is even taught in earlier standards, even in Bal Mandir.

**(5) Teaching Methods OR Methods of teaching:**
Teaching methods are also very much responsible for good education of English. Direct method is recognized as a scientific method of teaching English in our Country, this method is not very much in vague. Still, the translation method is much used in almost all the schools and specially in Gujarat; this method is in much use.

**(6) Sub-standard of Text-Books:**
The text-books of English are of very low standard. They have got no relevance to the need of our students. They need a drastic change and improvement. Although this year, the Gujarat state has taken step regarding the sub-standard of text books and according to the new syllabus, introduced in std VIII and XI they have tried to introduce certain changes in English text-book, but still text-book lack language functions.

**(7) Lack of suitable language teaching aids:**
Our schools are not well equipped with suitable language teaching aids. Even pictures, charts, modals, lannel board are not available. Only during training period same interest is noticed among pupil - teachers in this regard. The movement they became teachers they do not use audio-visual aids. English can be best taught and learnt by these teaching aids.

**(8) Lack of efficient teachers:**
The teachings of English in schools are in the hand of teachers who neither know English nor are trained in the teaching methodology of English subject. The sole aim of teachers is to get their student pass in the examination by fair and foul. That is why the standard of English language of our students is going to be deteriorated.

**(9) Inefficient teacher education system:**
The teachers are not imparted proper training at B.Ed, levels. The languages teachers are not properly trained in the content matter and methodology of English subject students are receivers and producers of language. They produce what they receive from their teacher. Most of the time is imparted to the compulsory subject. The teaching subject is neglected.

**(10) Traditional examination system:**
The new methods of examination with oral and written test are not applied by the teachers. They still use the traditional method of examination the aims and objective of teaching is not achieved through the traditional examinations.`,
