English language is gateway to the world culture. It is a major window on the modern world. It is great importance for an English teacher to know what are the aims of education which are to be achieved through his teaching on one hand and on the other hand, he should know what he is trying to achieve by teaching English. The knowledge of aims and objectives of education and teaching will enable him to decide his methods, techniques and approaches of teaching English. English is taught as a second language in India today.

### Definition of objectives:

Dr. B.S. Bloom has defined educational objectives as, "The desired goal or outcome at which instruction is aimed."

Suppose a teacher wants his pupils to improve hand writing. Here the outcome desired or goal aimed at its improvement of handwriting. The teacher will teach students in such a way that it will help in improving hand - writing. So, the goal or the desired outcome of improving hand - writing would be the objective of teaching.

### Characteristics of Good objectives:

- Objectives should be based on psychological principles. They should fulfill the needs and interests of students.
- They should be for the development of students,
- They should be helpful in acquiring democratic aims.
- They should be for changing or modifying students behavior.
- They should be tangible in ordinary circumstances,
- They should be useful.
- They should be in terms of changes expected in the pupil and not a duties of the teacher.
- Each statement should have only objective in it.
- They should be according to the age and mental level of the students.
- They should be helpful in changing the behavior of students.

### Objective of English Teaching:

L.A.C. strong once proclaimed, "For us who speak English. English is everything ... English is not a subject, English is our life." But this is not true for English in India, because here it is a foreign language. It is taught as a second or a third language in schools. Its teaching and learning in schools is inspired by one aim - the utilitarian aim. This aim can be achieved by acquiring practical command of English. Yet, clear cut objectives should be stated, so that good planning can be done and right type of methods and techniques of teaching can be adopted, as printed out by P. Gurrey, "The careful thinking out of a detailed and well defined objective for the lessons will do more than almost anything else 'to improve a teacher's work and to make it effective."

### Types of Objectives:

There are two types of objectives of English teaching, they are:

1. **Language development** - It is for the students of the classes V to IX. During this stage, the chief aim of English is language development. This means that English should be taught not as literature but as language. It has been said by Thompson and Coyatt: "To aim at literature is to miss the way to language. To aim at language is to pave the way to literature." Hence at this stage, language development should be the chief objective.
2. **Literary development**

[At B.Ed. level we have to aim at language development objective only]

We can divide the aims of teaching English into two:

1. **Comprehension** - (i) Oral Comprehension & (ii) Written comprehension
2. **Expression** - (i) Oral expression and (ii) Written expression

This means that teaching of English in India should have fourfold objectives of eng. language teaching.

1. **Semantic** - related to understanding.
2. **Phonetic** - deals, with sound, spelling, pronunciation.
3. **Graphic** - related to writing
4. **Phonetic Cum Graphic** - deals with reading.

These four aspects indicate the following four objectives of English language teaching. They are:

1. To enable the pupils to comprehend / understand spoken English.
2. To enable the pupils to comprehend / understand written English.
