### 8.1 Meaning and importance of planning:

Planning helps in the successful completion of any human activity. Careful planning of any enterprise leads to its ultimate success and benefits to the person or persons concerned. Teaching is one such important activity where detailed thinking and planning will yield handsome rewards in the form of effective learning by students.

Language being a skill subject needs careful handling as it is different from content subjects. The teacher should be familiar with the syllabus in English, which is laid out in the form of structures and vocabulary items.

Planning involves, firstly, the allocation of the prescribed lessons on units, term wise, month wise and week wise. Spread out evenly over the whole year. Secondly, lesson planning every day serves to clarify the ideas of the teacher on what to teach (the syllabus and the units) and how to teach it.

### 8.2 IMPORTANCE OF LESSON - PLAN FOR ENGLISH TEACHING

> "Planning is the preparation for the arrangement of strategies to be used, for achieving the desired goal based on some objectives."

Planning plays an important part in the successful execution of any task and assignment. The teacher knows about the syllabus, text books, supplementary books and other instructional materials and activities that he has to cover during the year. Planning will enable the teacher to break up the course in convenient units for each term, each week and each month.

Good lesson-plan is pre-requisite to a good and effective teaching. The teacher must know before hand what he is going to take up to teach in a particular period. A lesson-plan helps a teacher to define his aims and objectives, think of activities and techniques to realize them and the audio - visual aids to be used.

### 8.3 TASK ANALYSIS:

Over the cast fifty years there has been a great deal of research into the nature of language, the components of various languages, their similarities and differences and the methods of teaching them.

Language is a skill like painting or swimming and the more one practices it the better painter, swimmer or speaker he will be. All the skills whether it is swimming, painting or driving all are task oriented, some task is designed for their learning in the same way to make the pupils acquire the mastery on all the four skills, the teacher should design - the task accordingly.

The four skills are:
1. Listening (passive/receptive)
2. Speaking (active/productive)
3. Reading (passive/receptive)
4. Writing (active/productive)

### 8.4 CONTENT ANALYSIS

In teaching as a second language, one important consideration is how much language are we going to teach the students and in what order. In view of the limited time available for English i.e. 6 periods a week and 6 years of study. Obviously the quantity of language to be taught will be limited.

The most easily identifiable elements of the English language are its vocabulary and sentence patterns. While the sound system is learnt in the early stages by imitation and practice, a conscious attempt has to be made by the pupils in learning the words (lexical units) and sentences (syntactical items).

Content analysis is the analysis of the material content developed by the teacher to make the content a learning content covering all the skills.

### 8.5 TYPES OF PLANNING

Types of planning:
- **Year plan** - Covers all the aspects of English teaching of four skills LSRW along with schedule of remedial work.
- **Unit plan** - Each unit subdivided and planned accordingly by allotting the duration of teaching day wise, Week wise & month wise by determining objectives & techniques to achieve those objectives
- **Individual lesson plan** - Each lesson divided from the unit and prepared accordingly to learners age keeping in mind objectives, techniques, methods adopted, evaluation & Assignment

#### (A) YEAR PLAN:

It is the yearly calendar of all the units in the syllabus divided month wise, week wise and day wise. But this planning should be done after drawing the objectives of teaching English.

Along with the division of the units lesson wise, grammar, composition, language lab schedules, other language activities, excursions, trips, English movies schedule, seminar and workshop etc should also be planned by the English teacher.

#### (B) UNIT TEACHING PLAN

A unit teaching plan in English, language is different from 'a period plan teaching.' As the term indicates 'a period plan' considers the duration of one period which may be either 35 or 40 minutes and the teacher planning a 'period plan' has to concentrate only on those specific objectives which he may be able to achieve during the period.

The 'Unit plan' when subdivided, breaks into period plans. The 'unit plan' in English very much depends upon the principles adopted in the preparation of the textbook and also the objectives of English language teaching accepted by the state as well as the nation.

#### (C) INDIVIDUAL LESSON PLAN:

It has been rightly said that "a school day must be a succession of activities and experiences of great variety and stimulation, designed to develop pupils to a maximum in the times available."

Individual lesson plan is for to facilitate the teacher giving in it the details of learning activities. It helps the individual at his best when he thinks before he actually teaches. In the individual lesson-plan, the teaching point, its concept should be quite clear in the mind of the teacher.`
