  content: `## (6) PSYCHOLOGY OF LEARNING FOREIGN LANGUAGE

English is a second language. It is a foreign language. Mother tongue is learnt by imitation. Mother tongue is caught but foreign language is taught to be caught. English is taught as a second language in India because it has become lingua-franca between speakers of different languages of the world. The English teacher should teach English language in such a way that the desired goal or learning may be achieved. There are different approaches for the teaching and learning process of language such a psychological, linguistic and Pedagogical principles. These principles of learning a language are based upon keen observation and research and experimentation. These principles are very helpful for the English teachers to raise the standard of English language. The psychological linguistic and pedagogical principles are described below.

### (1) The principle of motivation Interest and variety:

In the words of coren:

> "In the teaching of class-subjects the actual work of mind training is being performed. In early lessons in English, the weapon is being forged, the tools are being made with which the mind training to be performed. In English lessons, the teacher is hoeing the soil so that it may be able to receive the seed and give the sweet fruits."

It is a psychological principle; motivation is the core of learning. If a student is motivated by the teacher to learn English he can himself learn the language. If a child is to learn, he must be motivated. Motivation can be classified into two broad-heads.

- **Intrinsic Motivation (Internal motivation)** - Intrinsic or internal motivation is related to the internal nature of the individual emotions. The child is motivated by his own ambitions and desires.
- **Extrinsic Motivation (External motivation)** - But sometimes, the learner is not internally motivated, there would be the need of extrinsic or external motivation for the learner to achieve the particular objective of English teaching. External motivation is developed and created by the English teacher in the learner.

The purpose of motivation is to create a zeal to learn something new in language. A child learns mother tongues in a easier way because there is an internal desire of a child to express his feelings and thoughts in his mother tongue. But to learn a foreign language like English it is rather difficult on the part of English teacher to motivate him internally. This can be made easy by creating the extrinsic or external motivated which can be developed with the help of pictures, models, maps, charts and audio - visual aids.

Motivation, Interest and Variety are interrelated terms. There is no learning without interest and there is no interest without motivation and there is no motivation without varieties of different physical and mental activities concerning the teaching-learning process. Motivation is the superhighway to learning. Motivation involves need, desire and interest to react. When desire to earn money and desire to learn language brings the response and reaction in individual, motivation takes place. The attention span of the learner is short in our young boys and girls. The attention span can be enlarged by creating the interest among them through the varieties of audio visual-aids, activities and situations.

### (2) Habit formation:

Learning language is a skill of habit formation. Habit is the nature of man which makes the speech automatic and natural habit formation includes four types of habits:

- Habit of Listening
- Habit of Speaking
- Habit of Reading
- Habit of writing

Plamer says in his book "The principles of language study."

> "Language learning is essentially a habit forming process, a process during which we acquire new habits."

Apart from the habits of four skills of language the following habits should be formulated in the students by our English teachers:

- Habit of Imitating
- Habit of Repeating
- Habit of Spelling
- Habit of Correct use of language
- Habit of Correct Pronounciation
- Habit of Consulting dictionary
- Habit of Going to library
- Habit of reading of newspapers, journals, magazines and story books.

### (3) The principle of conductive environment OR The principle of exposure OR The principle of Naturalness and Imitation:

The child learns his mother tongue more rapidly because he is given a conductive environment for speaking the language and he is exposed to the environment where this language is spoken and written. He finds language exposure at home, school and society. The habits of listening, speaking, reading and writing all require the constant practice and exposure which is possible only in a conductive environment created by the family, school, neighborhood and society. In the beginning, the child learns his language from his mother, father, brother, sister and friends of his age.

John Hope Mason Says:

> "To make a language natural it must be spoken. It is fruitless to make language that exists only on the written pages."

### (4) The principle of linking with life:

Linking with subject matter with life is and of the important principles of any teaching. It is the duty of an English teacher that he should encourage his students to use the structures of English language in their daily life situations. The students come in the close contact with their teachers headmasters, classmates, playmates and get ample opportunities to express their ideas with them. All these experiences are the part of life experience of our students. School is the miniature of society. The teacher should create the real and life-like situations to convey the meaning of words and sentences of English language.

### (5) The principle of proper order:

The language learning is a skill which involves listening, speaking, reading and writing.

Listening is the language of Ear, speaking is the language of tongue, Reading is the language of eyes and writing is the language of Hand. Proper order of learning a language is:

1. Listening
2. Speaking
3. Reading
4. Writing

Mr. J.A. Bright proposed the following order of teaching which is based on his experiment on learning English as foreign language:

1. Listening
2. Speaking
3. Writing
4. Reading

### (6) The principal of Aural - Oral Approach OR The principle of Phonology:

The child learns speaking his mother tongue before reading and writing it. The beginners should be taught with speech lesson in which words and small sentences are to be heard and listened. Oral practice is the quickest way of learning a language.

E.G. Kiffson says:

> "Learning to speak a language is always the shortest road - to learning, to read and to write. Living languages should be taught as living speech, they should be taught orally."

Oral approach is based upon the psychological foundation which must be applied in the beginning stage. The following advantages of oral approach are:

1. Strengthens Listening and speaking skills.
2. Develop Reading and writing skills.
3. Mastering over function grammar.
4. It is an economical approach
5. Easy evaluation of the performance
6. Lays the foundation of correct pronunciation.
7. Promotes fluency of speech.

### (7) The principle of selection:

The total language materials cannot be taught within a short time. Therefore, there is the need of proper selection of language materials to be prescribed for the different grades. The criteria to choose a particular course for particular class is called the principle of selection. The learning materials should be selected keeping in view the following principles.

1. **Principle of fluency:** Words used frequently.
2. **Principle of Range:** The words and structure having a greater range should be selected.
3. **Principle of availability:** Words and structures of highest frequency that occur against and again in situation is said to be highly available.
4. **Principle of Coverage:** Words, which cover a large area of depicting their meaning should be selected for teaching the language.
5. **Principle of daily usefulness:** Words which are of daily use at home, in school, to talk on telephone, in society should be selected for teaching.

### (8) The principle of Gradation:

The order in which the language material is graded and classified to the learners is called the principle of gradation. Grading of language materials should be based on the following principles.

- Principles of simplicity
- Principle of familiarity
- Principle of teachability
- Principle of grouping
- Principle of sequencing.

### (9) The principle of learning by Doing:

A foreign language can be learnt quickly and easily by doing the language activities. Students should not be mere passive listeners. They may speak out the words and sentences, draw figures on the black-board, drill a structure, play a language game, recite the poem and collect various objects, use the different situations of class-room and out side class-room.

### (10) The principle of multiple line of approach:

According to this principle, an English teacher should adopt many approaches to reach the goal. The different approaches should be used as illustrated below:

#### Different- approaches of teaching language:

1. Social Approach
2. Functional Approach
3. Cultural Approach
4. Behavioral Approach
5. Phonetic Approach
6. Situational Approach
7. Bilingual Approach
8. Structural Approach
9. Oral Approach
10. Communicative

### (11) The principle of accuracy and correctness:

It means the words should be used in proper contexts and imparts the meaning relevant to it. The selection of words should be right. The use of words should be economical and expression should be impressive.`
