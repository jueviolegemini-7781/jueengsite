It is common knowledge that children learn their mother tongue with ease as soon as they begin to speak, and long before their schooling begins. Even if some of them do not go to school later and remain illiterate, they pick up a lot of spoken language to manage their day-to-day affairs. Children learn their first language as easily as they learn to walk or to run.

Learning a language is not an intellectual activity like learning maths or physics. All normal children are seen to possess same innate skill in using language for their immediate purposes.

Planning and method generally includes what to teach and techniques includes how to teach. Method includes selection and gradation of the material to be taught while technique includes how the meaning and form are conveyed (presentation), how the planned material should be maximum utilized by the learners (practice), what is done to make the use of the language unconscious (review) and how the four skills learned by the learner are statistically responded by them (testing).

### 9.1 SKILL OF SET INDUCTION:

This is the first step of the teaching task on the part of the teaching task on the part of the teacher set induction is the pre-stage of presentation. Once the content is selected of the lesson properly bearing in mind the children's level, their linguistic needs and objectives of the lesson are clearly defined.

The teacher trainee should bear in mind the following points for set induction:
- We should always start with a positive statement because a positive statement creates a positive environment.
- Create the atmosphere of English while in the stage of set induction.
- Make pupils emotionally and mentally ready to get adjusted in the created atmosphere of English and get motivated to learn English.
- Take into consideration the previous knowledge or the experiences of the pupils and associate the lesson with it.
- We are dwelling in the technological era, if possible the use of computer or sides can work out wonderful in this stage of teaching.
- Fantasies have always motivated and enhanced the thinking of not only pupils but also of grown up.

### 9.2 Skill of presentation:

After set induction, is the next stage i.e. the presentation. In this stage the teacher introduces the lesson effectively and pupils are made ready emotionally and from knowledge point of view to receive the new lesson.

The presentation starts with model reading of the lesson. Reading aloud with stress, interaction appropriate pause is useful in the beginners classes.

Then there is silent reading of the lesson. The silent reading in later life is to develop speed of reading with comprehension.

**Principles of Presentation:**

1. **Principle of effective introduction** - The introduction part of a successful presentation should not just give an outline of the presentation. It should create interest in the students.
2. **Principle of well structured organized, psychologically and logically arranged body of presentation.**
3. **Principle of using language in situation** - The cardinal principle of learning a language is learning through meaningful contexts and situations.
4. **Principle of motivation** - During the teacher's demonstration this principle should also be included.
5. **Principle of effective conclusion** - The conclusion is the final attempt to make the pupils remember what is presented.

### 9.3 Skill of Practice:

Language learning is a skill like learning cycling, swimming. Palmer, in his book "The principles of language study" says, "Language learning is essentially a habit forming process, a process during which we acquire new habits, and these habits are formed by the adequate practice given by the teacher in the classroom."

The teacher of English should follow the structural approach, communicative, approach, situational approach and substitution tables for drilling, practice will expose the pupils to English language learning.

### 9.4 Review:

The teacher has performed his task of teaching, but what that - teacher has tested the pupils by doing evaluation, but what's about the teacher?

Review is not meant or the process of evaluation. It is a comprehensive tool to assess the success of the teaching efforts.

### 9.5 Testing

The main purpose of our teaching is to improve students performance in terms of speaking, reading and writing English in order to check students performance after a period of teaching he make use of certain testing techniques.

**What is testing?**

The process of gathering and interpreting evidence on changes in the behavior of all students as they progress through the unit, lesson or any other content is called testing. It is the device to obtain the required measurement in our teaching - learning process.

The ideal lesson plans always contains the standard test items based on the following:
- Each test item must be based on one of the objectives with which the teacher started teaching.
- Every test item must be valid. That is, it should test what it claims to test.
- Each test item should be reliable.
- Test item must discriminate students as widely as possible.
- Coverage is another characteristic of good testing.
- Each test item should be clear and in unambiguous instruction.`
