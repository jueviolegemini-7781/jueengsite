### 10.1 The Direct Method of teaching:

> "To teach English directly is to establish a direct and immediate association between experience and expression." - H. Champion

In Direct Method of teaching, the emphasis is laid on fluency of speech.

> "Learning to speak a language is always by far the shortest road to learning and to write." - Kittson

It was realized that the foreign language should be learnt as the child learns his or her own mother-tongue. If we teach English by making associations between word and experience of the learner without the help of the mother-tongue, that is called the Direct - or Natural method.

**Characteristics of Direct Method:**
1. It creates the direct bond between language and thoughts.
2. Sentence is the unit of language not the word.
3. Audio-visual aids are used to explain the meaning.
4. Stress is given on speech.
5. The use of mother tongue is not allowed
6. Grammar is taught indirectly and inductively
7. Questionnaire technique is adopted.
8. Emphasis is given on pronunciation.
9. Vocabulary is taught on the basis of selection and gradation.
10. The two maxims of teaching are followed: from simple to complex and from concrete to abstract.

**Advantages of Direct Method:**
- It promotes fluency of speech.
- It follows the principle of whole to part.
- It emphasizes on pronunciation of the language.
- It lays emphasis on oral approach of the language.
- It is directly related to the language skills: Listening, speaking, reading and writing.
- It promotes practice and oral drill.
- It increases the active vocabulary from passive vocabulary.
- It develops self confidence.

**Disadvantage of Direct Method:**
- If ignores reading and writing.
- It ignores the teaching of grammar.
- It ignores deep and understanding without the help of mother tongue.
- It is time - consuming.
- Only the intelligent children can be benefited by this method.
- The method is very expensive.
- Trained teachers are not available in this method in India.

### 10.2 BILINGUAL METHOD:

Bilingual Method is recently developed and invented by Prof. C. Dodson of Wales in this method; mother tongue is used to explain the meaning of words phrases, idioms, sentences structures and grammatical rules.

**Main characteristics of Bilingual Method of teaching:**
1. Use of mother-tongue is to explain the meanings of language materials at the initial stages.
2. Sentence is the unit of teaching.
3. Practice and drill in sentence pattern are done without the keep of mother tongue.
4. Word to word translation is done.
5. Mother tongue is used when it is necessary to explain the difficult area of language.

**Advantages of Bilingual Method:**
- It leads to accuracy of the teaching English language.
- It ensures fluency of speech.
- A lot of practice and drill are given in speaking English.
- It saves time in teaching English.
- It suits the average teachers and average students.
- It is less - costly and suited to all types of schools.

**Disadvantages of Bilingual Method:**
- It creates muddle in English teaching due to the use of mother-tongue.
- It may create confusion among students due to the contrast between the features of two language.
- It may be degenerated into translation Cum-grammar method.
- It develops an undesirable habit of language mix up.

### 10.3 STRUCTURAL APPROACH OF TEACHING A LANGUAGE:

Due to the efforts and researches done by British council of institute of education university of London and many others, this method came into existence. It is also known as 'New Approach' or 'Aural - Oral Approach'.

**Meaning of structural Approach:**

In this approach the basis of teaching is - structures or patterns of English.

Menon and Patel says: "The basic principles and techniques of the structural approach do not differ widely from those of the Direct-method and there are many teachers who still believe that it is the direct method with some additions and alterations necessitated by modern researches into foreign language learning."

**The meaning of Structure:**

Structure is nothing but a graded and classified grammar. It is an arrangement of words in certain order that conveys some meaning.

**TYPES OF STRUCTURES:**

1. **Sentence patterns** - French defines sentences pattern as, "the word pattern means a model from which many things of the same kind and shape can be made."
2. **Phrase Patterns** - Phrase is a word or group of words which express an idea without its being a sentence or clause.
3. **Idiomatic Structure** - In idiomatic structure, idioms are taught as a unit.
4. **Formula structure** - In formula structure words are used on certain occasions e.g. Good morning; Have a nice day; Thank you.

**Basic Principles of structural approach:**
- Importance of speech
- Forming language habit
- Situation teaching.
- Learners are Active Learners.
- Selection and gradation of structures.

**Advantages of structural approach:**
- Speech is emphasized.
- Language habit formation is stressed.
- Language materials are carefully selected and graded.
- Students become active because they learn language through activity.
- Language is taught in a meaningful situation.
- Oral aspect of the language is given more importance.
- It provides the opportunity for expression.

### 10.4 COMMUNICATIVE APPROACH:

The Communicative Approach is the recent and latest approach which is about ten year old. Teachers have known that their aim was to get students communicating successfully outside the class-room.

**Characteristics of Communicative Approach:**
- It lays emphasis on language in use rather than language as structure.
- It gives emphasis on the semantic objectives of the language.
- It lays less stress on grammar.
- The need of the learner is to communicate his feelings and thought to others.
- The approach is based upon the need analysis and planning to prepare communicative curricular and syllabuses.
- It provides the communicative opportunities where the students may be able to communicate their ideas through dialogue, discussions, debate.

### 10.5 SITUATIONAL APPROACH:

This approach basically tries to teach English as the child learns his own mother-tongue. The main stand points of another-tongue learning are:
- Every item of mother-tongue is learnt in a real situation.
- Whatever the child understands and expresses is connected with his own life.
- The situation in which the child learns the mother-tongue are repeated again and again.

**Main Characteristics:**
- The teacher introduces new words incidentally in the class.
- Many opportunities are offered to the learners to associate the meaning of new word with corresponding situations.
- Appropriate materials are used to create proper situations.
- Constant repetition is stressed.
- Several examples are given in a short period.

**Advantages of situational approach:**
- It creates the interest in teaching.
- It is action based approach.
- It is based upon learning by action and learning by doing.
- It emphasis on listening and hearing skill of language.

### 10.6 AN ECLECTIC APPROACH:

Probably most teachers of English language, nowadays, if asked, what method they use, would reply that their approach is 'eclectic' By this, they mean that they do not follow any single method, but rather that they use a selection of techniques.

Such an to the teaching of English has many advantages. For one thing, it is more flexible and can easily be adapted to suit a wide variety of teaching situation.

> "If it works, use it."

There is, of course, still the problem of knowing what we mean by 'success' Every language teacher should begin by considering what the aims of his pupils are, both in the short and in the long run, and judge success by whether these are achieved.`
